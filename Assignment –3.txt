Overview of SQL.
Does ANSI recognize the data type DATE?
Yes, ANSI SQL (American National Standards Institute Structured Query Language) recognizes the DATE data type. It is part of the SQL standard and is used to store date values without a time component. The DATE type typically stores dates in the format YYYY-MM-DD depending on the SQL implementation, though the specific format may vary slightly across different database systems.

Which subdivision of SQL is used to insert values into tables?
The subdivision of SQL used to insert values into tables is the Data Manipulation Language (DML). DML includes SQL commands that manipulate data within the database, such as:

INSERT: Used to insert data into tables.
UPDATE: Used to modify existing data.
DELETE: Used to remove data from tables.
For example, to insert data into a table, you use the INSERT INTO statement:

INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3);
