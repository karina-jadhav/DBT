•	Database Management System Limitations: Some systems may limit the display of rows based on configuration settings or the current query being executed.
•	SQL Query: If an SQL query is used, it may not include a limit on the number of rows displayed (e.g., SELECT * FROM Customers LIMIT 5;).
•	Empty Table: The table may be empty, resulting in no rows to display.
